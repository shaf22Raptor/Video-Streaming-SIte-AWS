# Video-Streaming-SIte-AWS

## Project Overview
This repository showcases my cloud development skills using AWS infrastructure. It contains a simple video streaming service built with a serverless-first approach, integrating several core AWS services to demonstrate scalable, production-ready architecture patterns.

### Key AWS Services used
Amazon S3 – for secure video file storage
Amazon API Gateway – for exposing backend APIs
AWS Lambda – for backend processing and video metadata handling
Amazon RDS – for relational data storage (MySQL)
Amazon Cognito – for user authentication and identity management
Amazon SQS – for asynchronous job handling (e.g., video transcoding workflows)
Amazon EC2 – to handle transcoder microservice
AWS Amplify – for front-end hosting and deployment
